            <p>
                In terms of development, the first year of a cat’s life is equal to the first 15 years of a human
                life.<br>
                After
                its second year, a cat is 25 in human years. And after that, each year of a cat’s life is equal to about
                7 human
                years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hearing of the average cat is at least five times keener than that of a human adult.
