                <h3>CATS</h3>
    <p>
        In terms of development, the first year of a cat’s life is equal to the first 15 years of a human life.<br>
        After
        its second year, a cat is 25 in human years. And after that, each year of a cat’s life is equal to about 7 human
        years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cats can rotate their ears 180 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hearing of the average cat is at least five times keener than that of a human adult.
